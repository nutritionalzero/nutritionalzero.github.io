Norns is a small computer dedicated to making music. At any given moment it could be a looping sampler, a sequencer, a synthesizer, an FX unit, or something completely alien. Which reminds me: with its austere sci-fi casing and retrofuturist monochrome display, Norns looks and behaves like something you might see in a Ridley Scott film. Monome themselves refer to something similar—"past. present. future. norns is many tomorrows."—on their website and, when interacting with Norns, you'll probably be reminded of the glory days of so-called personal computing. _Everything was simpler then, and yet the possibilities offered by technology seemed broader._

Fundamental to Norns are its apps (also called scripts), which you load to determine how the device behaves. There are many of these. Unlike some larger devices—e.g. the Elektron Octatrack—which might be sampling, sequencing, and applying FX in several ways at once, Norns generally performs one function at a time, determined by its active app. Which isn't to say its simplistic, since many of the apps blend sequencing and sampling in unique ways...

Norns has three encoders and three keys. They're not labelled in any way and they do different things depending on where you are in the system.

For example, when you first turn on Norns, you are looking at a kind of "main menu. The knobs and buttons will navigate you around this menu. However, when you're inside an app, the buttons and knobs will do other things such as playing sounds or sequencing notes to be sent to a synthesizer.
