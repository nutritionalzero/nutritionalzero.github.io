Rample, from Squarp Instruments, is a sample player and processor for the eurorack synthesizer. Its performant and excellent-sounding playback engine starts with a four-voice kit loaded from the included microSD card. Each voice in the kit can consist of up to 12 samples, and how the Rample chooses which layer to play (randomly, cyclically, etc.) can be configured onboard as well as via MIDI or CV.
